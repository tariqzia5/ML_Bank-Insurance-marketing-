        "A Portuguese retail bank was addressed, with data collected from 2008 to 2013. \n",
        "This data is related with direct marketing campaigns of the banking institution. \n",
        "The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The intent was to get the customer to subscribe (buy) to \n",
        "its product, which is, long term deposit scheme.\n",
        "To facilitate this, often more than one call was made to a single client.\n",
        "The telemarketing data was captured in a set of 150 features. It was further analyzed with respect to \n",
        "bank client, product and social-economic attributes and was narrowed down to 22 features.\n",
        "Finally, a data-source file with 20 features and one desired target has been selected to formulate the proposed model\n",
        "based on a data-driven approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## OBJECTIVE :\n",
        "This project is a data mining approach to predict the success of telemarketing calls for selling \n",
        "bank long-term deposits. It aims to ascertain with a good probability, as to which of the clients\n",
        "are the most likely to start a new long term deposit with them. A Data Model has to be created to predict this with an acceptable accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selected data source file = bank-additional-full.csv\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## BUSINESS LOGIC :\n",
        "TERM DEPOSIT - A term deposit is sum of money which is deposited with the bank for a fixed number of years. It cannot be withdrawn before the completion of the term i.e. the number of years. It earns a fixed rate of interest annually. It is also known as a fixed deposit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since it is a deposit, there is no risk of delinquency involved. The bank does not have to get or share any credit score information with credit bureau. Hence, the decision making process would be the bank's internal process. \n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective is to predict the customers who will subscribe to the term deposit (buy the product) with maximum accuracy. Model explanation is not of paramount importance as the decision making would be internal in this case. So even the models following black-box method would be acceptable.\n"

It may be possible that, if a dataset has 10000 records, the decision tree will fit every singe record into individual leaf nodes. So we will have 10000 leaf nodes and 10000 rules. Such a DTree will have 100% accuracy.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Stopping criteria\n",
        "We have to limit the size of the Dtree so that it can work well with all datasets. So we define two parameters to check the tree growth. We expect to get leaf nodes with purity or class dominance. So, maximum possible accuracy with limited leaf nodes.\n",

We may implement sampling and SMOTE techniques on this set to handle class imbalance before building the model. The 20% set is called test data. It is a reflection of the real world data distribution. It is used to validate the model. The accuracy we get on test dataset is the accuracy of the model. We can expect to get similar accuracy on other real world datasets. Train and test datasets should have mutually exclusive records.\n",

        "* Sample data for each tree should be bootstrap sample.\n",
        "* We want every model should be independent. So we do not use all the features of the original dataset, rather we use few features. If p is number of features used in a single tree and t is the total number of features then p << t. Or we can use p in the range of sqrt(t). Every set of p features is randomly selected from the original dataset.\n",
        "* Since less number of features are selected, we can be liberal in choosing the max_depth for each tree. Generally we can go for a depth which is 50% more than the stand-alone Dtree model depth built earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random forest is called a black-box model because we cannot exactly find out which of the variables are high impact variables. We cannot se at what values the split happens. We only get the final prediction as the output. So, for scenarios where understanding the model is not important, rather we need only high accuracy, Random Forest is a good choice."
